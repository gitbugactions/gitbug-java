In other words, could either of these ever be false when the first three conditions are true?", "Yes, without this we had one failing test (`minimum_threshold_test`) -- since everyone under the threshold is still considered active until they're eliminated.", "I was confused by this until I realized that you meant to refer to the `no_one_meets_minimum` test. That makes sense. Maybe add an inline comment explaining why we need this condition?\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to explain why we need `numSeatsUnfilled == 1`, since it's also not obvious (at least to me) at first glance why it's necessary in addition to the other conditions.", "Added comments explaining it all! The numSeatsUnfilled is a check to see if the winner was selected in a previous round."]}]}
